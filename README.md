# Tic Tac Toe with Hand Gesture Recognition

This project implements a **Tic Tac Toe** game using hand gestures for interaction. The game is built using **OpenCV** for video capture, the **CvZone HandTrackingModule** for detecting hand gestures, and **NumPy** for matrix management.

## Features

- Hand gesture control to mark your move in the game.
- Simple and intuitive interface that allows for gesture-based interactions.
- Tracks wins for both players (X and O).
- Automatically detects the winner and highlights the winning combination.
- Option to reset the game.

## How It Works

1. The game captures video using your webcam and tracks your hand using the CvZone Hand Tracking module.
2. You can make a move by forming a **scissors gesture** (index and middle finger up).
3. The game detects your gesture and marks an "X" or "O" in the appropriate cell of the Tic Tac Toe grid.
4. The game keeps track of player moves, detects the winner, and displays the score for both players.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** (`cv2`)
- **CvZone** (for hand detection)
- **NumPy** (for array manipulation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoe-hand-gesture.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tictactoe-hand-gesture
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless numpy cvzone
    ```

4. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python tictactoe.py
    ```

## Usage

- **Start the game**: The webcam will capture your hand.
- **Make a move**: Use the scissors gesture (index and middle fingers up) and place your move on the Tic Tac Toe grid by bringing your fingers together over a cell.
- **Current Turn**: Displays whose turn it is ("X" or "O").
- **Winner**: If a player wins, the game highlights the winning combination.
- **Reset**: Press `R` to reset the game and play again.
- **Quit**: Press `Q` to quit the game.

## Game Interface

- **Tic Tac Toe Grid**: A 3x3 grid drawn using OpenCV.
- **Player's Moves**: Displayed in real-time based on hand gestures.
- **Score Tracker**: Keeps track of how many games each player has won.

## Future Improvements

- Add more gesture-based controls to enhance user interaction.
- Implement multiplayer mode where two players can play from different devices.
- Add AI to allow single-player mode against the computer.
